# MurdochWeatherApp
Application to read very large amounts of weather data into a custom BST made with C++. There are multiple options to interpret the weather data e.g. average solar radiation over a specific month of year.

The weather data is stored in \Assignment2\data. \Assignment2\data\met_index.txt hold the files that will be read so multiple files of data a read into the application. 
Add data files to \Assignment2\data and add the data file name to \Assignment2\data\met_index.txt. There is already 3 years of data in the application (weather recorded every 10 minutes).

Documented using Doxygen. This can me found by \Assignment2\html\index.html or open any html file in the html folder.
